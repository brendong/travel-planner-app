# travel-planner-app

## Overview

travel-planner-app is a lightweight travel planning application that helps users plan trips, build itineraries, estimate budgets, and visualize routes on maps. This repository contains a simple Express-based backend and utility scripts for travel-related tasks (e.g., budget estimation).

This README is intended for the initial commit on branch `main`.

## Features

- Create and manage trip itineraries
- Estimate travel budgets (budget_estimation.py)
- Basic REST API for itineraries and trip data
- Map integration hooks for route/POI visualization

## Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express for the backend
- Python utilities for analysis/scripts (e.g., budget estimation)
- (Optional) Any frontend framework can be added in /client

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.8+ (for optional utilities)

## Quick Start (Backend)

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/brendong/travel-planner-app.git
   cd travel-planner-app

2. Install server dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the server (development):

   npm run dev

   or

   npm start

4. Server defaults:

   - Port: 3000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)

## Python Utilities

Some helper scripts are written in Python (e.g., budget_estimation.py). To run:

1. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install Python dependencies (if provided):

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run a script:

   python scripts/budget_estimation.py --help

## Project Structure (suggested)

- /server - Express backend (app.js, routes, controllers)
- /scripts - Python utilities and helper scripts (budget_estimation.py)
- /client - Frontend app (optional)
- README.md - This file
- .gitignore - Git ignore rules

(Adjust structure as features are implemented.)

## API (examples)

These are example endpoints to implement or extend:

- GET /api/trips - list trips
- POST /api/trips - create a trip
- GET /api/trips/:id - get trip details
- POST /api/trips/:id/itinerary - add itinerary item
- POST /api/budget/estimate - run budget estimation (may proxy to Python script)

## Development Notes

- Create a `.env` file to store environment variables (PORT, DB connection strings, API keys)
- Use `npm run lint` and `npm test` if those scripts are added
- Prefer small, well-tested commits for features

## Contributing
